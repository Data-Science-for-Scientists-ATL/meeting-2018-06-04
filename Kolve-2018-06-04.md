## transitioning from academia to commercial
- difficult to get traction in job search early on
- hard to translate experiecne
- lots of companies don't appreciate work that goes into advanced degrees
  + you need to showcase yourself
- what the hell does data science even mean?
  + companies want to show stockholders etc they're doing this


## possible data sci responsibilities
some companies very clearly defined, some smaller orgs this could be a one-man band
- pure stats and analytics
- data architecture & data engineering
  + SQL & NoSQL Data store
- data viz
  + can be a specialist: someone doing 
- software development
  + prototyping software proof-of-concepts

## where do I fit?
in some organizations, that is 1 person doing all of these things
- **ask companies how they define Data Science**
  + so you don't end up in situation
- **understand your strengths, weaknesses, passions**
- **if you can't explain to someone what you do as well as what you want to be doing move forward, it is hard for them to visualize how they can help you**
  + help explain this is what I'm doing
  + these are my goals, this is what I want to be doing
  + also useful for *networking at user groups*


## resume
- find a version or two that best represents your skills
- impossible to satisfy everyone's advice
- be vivid -- spoon feed your audience! (people = lazy)
  + 1st person reading likely isn't technologist or data scientist
    - may just be scanning for **key terms**
    - **you need to make clear what languages, frameworks, libraries you use**
  + be clear in what you're looking for & do -- **objective** can be great way to do it
  + Key Terms are well displayed in a "Skills Summary" section
    - resue those terms throughout your resume, in your experience section  -- allows your experience


ST: what does ehire do exactly?
CG: is eHire mostly Atlanta or outside the area?
  - we're mostly Atlanta-centric unless it's a really interesting opportunity

## example resume
 - DAN, version 1. Pretty good: had skills section, it was kept to one page
 - next version:
   + don't have to handuff yourself to one page. More than 2 you'd better have a lot of important stuff
   + he had objective
   + he moved education further up
     - when it's a differentiator, advanced degree from esteemed university, showcase that
   + augment skills summary
     - got more granular in terms of libraries that you use
   + on top of that, to make your experience more vivid, esp. if it's in a lab-type setting:
     - re-use those tools, libraries, etc.
   + **pay attention to the terminology people use in job positions you are interested in**
   + if you have Github, something like that to showcase the work you're doing
   + if you 
ST: is it good to have live links in-line or should you put them in footnotes?
JK: having them in-line increases chances that people will click on them as they're linking
SA: should you include all work you've done?
JK: as long as it's relevant to position, even slightly relevant: business analyst

## skills & keywords
all these
- cloud experience
  + different to be able to say in answer to "do you have cloud experience?" "no but I have played around with it" v. just "no"

SA: do you need cover letters?
JK: can help personify someone -- the %age of people that read such a letter is 10-20%, in today's world I don't think they're looked at as regularly
but can also be really good practice to go through in terms of clarifying what your experience is, what your goals are, etc.

## interviewing
- this is a skill -- continue to practice
- **you're doing that prep work so you can just go and be yourself. If you feel like you're having to be someone else, might not be good fit for you**
  + have done your research on company 
  + research backgrounds of interviewers
  + prepare thought provoking questions
    - these first 3 show your ability to identify important questions
    - demonstrates you can reach end-users, translate for non-experts
  + be able to speak to everything on your resume
  + use "I" terminology as opposed to "we"
    - talk to **your** commitments, **your** delivery in a specific setting
  + bring notebook -write down what you were asked
    - and write down how you answered questions
    - use any answer you didn't like as an opportunity to improve
  + strong closing!
    - find your own voice in addressing concerns
ST: is it okay to follow-up to thank note?
JK: not very many people do that anymore, if you're spending more than 15m on it you're getting into that creep factor
YW: is it better to send an email?
JK: if you got it someway, on their LinkedIn profile or they gave you their card, that's okay--you don't want them to be 

## advice & insight
from people in ATL community
- sr. data scientist, phd @ at&t
  + commercial domains not in biz of creating new knowledge
  + writing papers / reports less relevant than creating products & services
  + being able to apply state of art alogrithms more important than creating such algorithms & techniuqes

- vp data sci, fortune 500 innovation lab
  + love someone w/natural curiosity
  + I ask "what's last thing you learned on your own?"
  + advanced degree important to me, shows completion & accomplishment, differentiator to me
  + important that person has level of humility. Takes a little while to learn that it is okay not to be smartest person in room
  + ho do you translate what you've learned to a business; do you have maturity to understand bottom line impact to a business

- director of data sci, marketing software company
  + academia moves way too slowly, byt companies move way too fast. No happy medium
  + 2nd law of thermodynamics applies
  + unit testing good
  + critical role of "soft" (people) skills, clear communication about all of the above to other stakeholders and collaborators
  + keep people involved, keep communication open

  + "I choose to hire":
    - kids that care about success of product & peoplea roudn them
    - people that are eager to learn best practices
    - not hotshots looking for awesome skills

SA: in engineering company, how will this person fit into team + fit into group dynamics
This was often about past project the person had worked on, whether they could work with other groups, e.g. marketing team
JK: white board problem, for same reason--gives you opportunity to talk them through your thought processes, involve other people as you try to figure things out
DN: WRT seeing if you can work with group, doing research on everyone you will interview with is a good way

RM: as far as companies where it's a one-man band, are there red flags to look for?
JK: good question to ask, why did the last person leave

RM: Data sci is still a new field, but what is a career progression?
JK: hieararchies are still developing too, "senior data scientist" might branch into "manager of AI"
